He issues negative comments about my abilities, acts passive aggressively, has laughed when I ask questions, and generally has a condescending tone to me and the other junior on the team. I come from a BI background with experience in SQL and Python and this is my first data engineer role, especially one in corporate with highly structured releases and source control. I was very open that I wanted people to learn from when interviewing, but now I’m made to feel like an idiot and there’s barely any mentorship now that I’m on. I have a lot to learn but he barely helps and any time I’m not actively producing something (like when I take time to consolidate my notes or do training) he makes comments with a tone or even directly suggesting I’m not getting any work done.\\\\n\\\\nI’ve been in the role for two months so far and it’s seriously taking a toll on me mentally. I’ve only heard things from the grapevine, but I guess he agreed to postpone his retirement to stay on the team and get our current project done. All I hear from management (this guy is not my manager) is that Q1 is going to be even crazier than now and it just makes me think this is going to be even worse.\\\\n\\\\nI’ve already spoken to my manager and basically told him all of this. He’s done this to another junior ish person and also to our BA but not as bad as he does to me.
